## Overview:
This repository contains CAD for an objective 2-3 (O2-O3) assembly that is recommended for building a [single-objective light-sheet (SOLS)](https://github.com/amsikking/high_na_single_objective_lightsheet) microscope. The assembly should be:
- Mechanically and thermally stable.
- Relatively straightforward to align.
- Compatible with Nikon/Olympus and AMS-AGY v1/v2 objectives.
- Designed for tilt angles of 30deg (high NA O1) and 45deg (low NA O1).
- Capable of reproducing the [any immersion remote refocus' (AIRR)](https://amsikking.github.io/any_immersion_remote_refocus_microscopy/) SOLS microscope (55deg with AMS-AGY v2, Nikon or Olympus).

A total of 10 optical configurations are possible: [see this animation](https://github.com/amsikking/SOLS_O2-O3_optomechanics/blob/main/animation/output.gif).
