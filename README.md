## Overview:
This repository contains CAD for an objective 2 (O2) and objective 3 (O3) assembly for building a single-objective light-sheet (SOLS) microscope that should be:
- Mechanically and thermally stable
- Compatibe with Nikon/Olympus and AMS-AGY v1/v2 objectives
- Compatible with tilt angles of 30deg and 45deg for AMS-AGY v1/v2, and 55deg for AMS-AGY v2 (for any immersion remote refocus (AIRR) microscopy).
